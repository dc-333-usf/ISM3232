//Task 1
// First, ask the user for their name and save it as a string
let employeeName = "John";

//Then, we must assign an employee ID.
const employeeID = 102870;

//Last, we'll create a variable for activity status.
var isActive = true;

//Log the variables and their types to the console.
console.log(`Employee name: Value: ${employeeName} Type: ${typeof employeeName}
Employee ID: Value: ${employeeID} Type: ${typeof employeeID}
Active: Value: ${isActive} Type: ${typeof isActive}`);

//Task 2
//Declare variable productName using let, string value
let productName = "Table";

//Declare variable price with const, numerical value
const productPrice = 150;

//Declare an availability variable, boolean value
var isAvailable = true;

//Log the variables and their types
console.log(`Product Name: Value: ${productName} Type: ${typeof productName}
Product Price: Value: ${productPrice} Type: ${typeof productPrice}
Availability: Value: ${isAvailable} Type: ${typeof isAvailable}`);
